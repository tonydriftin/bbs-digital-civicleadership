1. Technology is Not Neutral
Every scholar emphasizes that technology reflects the values, assumptions, biases, and power structures of those who create it. Civic leaders must understand that technology choices are political choices.

2. Representation Matters in Tech Development
Diverse voices in technology development lead to more equitable and effective systems for all users. Civic leaders should advocate for inclusive technology development processes.

3. Algorithmic Accountability is Essential
Systems that make decisions about people's lives must be transparent, auditable, and subject to democratic oversight. Civic leaders have a role in ensuring algorithmic accountability.

4. Digital Rights are Human Rights
Access to technology, privacy, freedom from algorithmic discrimination, and digital self-determination are fundamental rights that require protection and advocacy.

5. Intersectionality in Technology Impact
Technology affects different communities differently based on race, gender, class, age, disability status, and other identities. Civic leaders must consider intersectional impacts.

6. Global Perspectives are Essential
Innovation and regulation shouldn't only come from wealthy Western countries. Civic leaders should seek out and amplify Global South and non-Western perspectives.

7. Youth Voices Must Be Centered
Young people who will live with technology's long-term consequences must be included in design and governance decisions that affect their futures.

8. Education Must Evolve
Digital literacy education must include understanding power structures, bias, and social implications of technology, not just technical skills.

9. Democratic Participation in Tech Governance
Communities affected by technology should participate meaningfully in decisions about its development, deployment, and regulation.

10. Technology Can Be a Tool for Justice
Despite challenges, technology can be a powerful tool for positive social change when developed inclusively and deployed equitably.

IMPORTANT REMINDERS FOR ALL PROMPTS:

Always Verify AI Responses For:
• Statistics and quantitative data
• Legal information and requirements
• Contact information for officials or organizations
• Specific procedural requirements
• Historical facts and dates
• Policy details and current status

Follow-Up Questions to Ask AI:
• "What are the limitations of this analysis?"
• "What perspectives might be missing?"
• "What additional information would strengthen this?"
• "How confident should I be in these recommendations?"
• "What could go wrong with this approach?"

Best Practices:
☐ Use AI as a starting point, not an endpoint
☐ Combine AI insights with human expertise and community input
☐ Always fact-check important claims
☐ Seek diverse perspectives beyond AI responses
☐ Be transparent about AI assistance when sharing work
☐ Maintain your authentic voice and values
☐ Consider potential unintended consequences

PROMPT REFINEMENT TECHNIQUES:

Be Specific:
Instead of: "Tell me about climate change"
Try: "Explain the main policy options for reducing carbon emissions in mid-sized American cities, including costs, benefits, and political feasibility"

Provide Context:
"I'm a high school student leader in Wisconsin working on [issue]. I need to understand [specific aspect] to prepare for [specific situation]."

Ask for Structure:
"Please organize your response with clear headings and bullet points, prioritizing the most actionable information for someone new to this issue."

Request Sources:
"Please suggest specific sources I can consult to verify this information and learn more, including both academic and practitioner perspectives."

Encourage Nuance:
"Please acknowledge uncertainty where it exists and note any significant debates or disagreements in this field."

EXAMPLE COMPLETE PROMPT:
"I'm a Badger Boys State participant researching renewable energy policy for a mock legislative session. Help me understand the main policy approaches Wisconsin could take to increase renewable energy adoption, including:

1. Key stakeholders and their positions
2. Economic costs and benefits 
3. Environmental and social impacts
4. Political feasibility considerations
5. Examples from other Midwest states

Please provide a balanced analysis that acknowledges different perspectives and suggests credible sources for further research. I need to present this to peers with varying political viewpoints, so please avoid partisan language and focus on evidence-based analysis."

Remember: AI is a powerful tool for civic research, but it works best when combined with critical thinking, fact-checking, community input, and human judgment. Use these prompts as starting points for deeper investigation and genuine civic engagement.`
